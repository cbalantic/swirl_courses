  Output: Welcome to R for Fledglings. Let's play with the ChickWeights data set.
                          
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Enter data(ChickWeight)
  CorrectAnswer: data(ChickWeight)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='data(ChickWeight)')
  Hint: Type or copy data(ChickWeight) in the console and press enter.
  
- Class: text
  Output: Good. You've just loaded in a dataset that comes with the R software.
    Let's take a look at the data.
  
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Enter ChickWeight into the console.
  CorrectAnswer: ChickWeight
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='ChickWeight')
  Hint: Type or copy ChickWeight into the console and press enter.

- Class: text
  Output: Nice work. The last command printed most of the rows of the ChickWeight 
    dataset. If you scroll to the top, you can see that this dataset contains a 
    column of weights, times of day, individual chicks, and the diets they were fed.
  
- Class: text
  Output: "Next, we are going to look at one chick's weight gain over time."  
  
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Enter ChickWeight[ChickWeight$Chick == 1,'weight'] into the console
  CorrectAnswer: ChickWeight[ChickWeight$Chick == 1,'weight']
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr="ChickWeight[ChickWeight$Chick == 1,'weight']")
  Hint: Type or copy ChickWeight[ChickWeight$Chick == 1,'weight'] into the console and press enter.

- Class: text
  Output: See the output? It is a list of the weights of Chick 1 over time.
    Next, you will save this output as an object named 'wts'.
    
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Enter wts <- ChickWeight[ChickWeight$Chick == 1,'weight'] into the console
  CorrectAnswer: wts <- ChickWeight[ChickWeight$Chick == 1,'weight']
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr="wts <- ChickWeight[ChickWeight$Chick == 1,'weight']");expr_creates_var("wts")
  Hint: Type or copy wts <- ChickWeight[ChickWeight$Chick == 1,'weight'] into the console and press enter.
  
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Great job! Now enter wts into the console to check that you've stored those weights.
  CorrectAnswer: wts
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr="wts")
  Hint: Type or copy wts into the console and press enter.

- Class: text
  Output: Let's see what happens if you add, subtract, divide, or multiply the wts
    object by something. 
  
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Enter wts + 2
  CorrectAnswer: wts + 2
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr="wts + 2")
  Hint: Type or copy wts + 2 into the console and press enter.
  
- Class: text
  Output: Great job. Next, you're going to add, substract, divide, or multiply 
    the wts object by a number of your choice, and you're going to save it as a new
     object.
  
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Enter new_wts <- wts*3
  CorrectAnswer: new_wts <- wts*3
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr="new_wts <- wts*3");expr_creates_var('new_wts')
  Hint: Type or copy new_wts <- wts*3 into the console and press enter.
  
- Class: text
  Output: Excellent work. Next, you'll save the new_wts object as a .csv file that
    has your named attached. (A .csv is like an excel file).

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Enter write.csv(new_wts, 'cathleen_wts.csv')
  CorrectAnswer: write.csv(new_wts, 'cathleen_wts.csv')
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr="write.csv(new_wts, 'cathleen_wts.csv')")
  Hint: Type or copy write.csv(new_wts, 'cathleen_wts.csv') into the console and press enter.

- Class: text
  Output: Good. Now you'll upload the .csv file you just created to the class dropbox. 
  
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Enter drop_upload('cathleen_wts.csv', dest = 'class_plots')
  CorrectAnswer: drop_upload('cathleen_wts.csv', dest = 'class_plots')
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr="drop_upload('cathleen_wts.csv', dest = 'class_plots')")
  Hint: Type or copy drop_upload('cathleen_wts.csv', dest = 'class_plots') into the console and press enter.
  
- Class: text
  Output: Good work. You've made it through the lesson. Done!
